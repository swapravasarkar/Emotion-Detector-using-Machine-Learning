This project aims to detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions using machine learning techniques. Leveraging Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow and OpenCV, this application offers a robust solution for real-time emotion detection.

Key Features:

Facial Expression Recognition: Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system accurately identifies facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.

Real-time Processing: With the integration of OpenCV, the system can perform emotion detection in real-time, making it suitable for applications like video conferencing, security systems, and more.

Model Training and Evaluation: The project includes scripts for training emotion detection models on large datasets such as CK+ or FER2013, along with evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the application, making it accessible to a wider audience.

Customization and Expansion: Developers can easily customize the model architecture, training parameters, and integrate additional features to suit specific requirements.

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the main application script (emotion_detector.py) to start the emotion detection process.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application via the GUI or integrate it into your existing projects.
